# SyMTIC
This is the Github page assoicated with the paper "Synthetic multi-inversion time magnetic resonance images for visualization of subcortical structures".
We provide inference code and pretrained weights running SyMTIC.
If harmonization or imputation is required for out-of-distribution datasets, we recommend using HACA3 as shown in the paper.
